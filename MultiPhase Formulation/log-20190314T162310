2D Locomotion Control using Mixed-integer Nonlinear Optimization
MultiPhase Formulation: Optimize over States, Control Inputs and Switching Times
 
Knots/Time Parameter tau Setup:
Good Example Setups: Number of Knots = 20 or 100 (Knot Step Length = tau_upper_limit/Number of Knots, tau_upper_limit = 1), Num of Phases: 4 or 5
Results in uniform tau discretization length
 
Input Number of Knots/Discretization of Time/parameter tau (e.g. 20): 
40
 
Input Number of Phases (e.g. 4, all phases have the same number of knots), larger the number of phases, more difficult for the solver to solve the problem (more integer variables): 
4
 
Input Terminal Time (Unit: Seconds, e.g. 1): 
1
Input Goal State (Travel Distance e.g. 0.5): 
0.5
 
Q matrix in the Cost Function is Sparse
A matrix for Constraints is Sparse
 
Set How the Terminal Conditions will be handled; 0: Hard Constraint; 1: Soft Constraint in Cost Function 
0
Terminal Condition is Set as Hard Constraints
